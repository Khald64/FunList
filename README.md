# FunList
 With this tool you can get the functions of any 'DLL' file in windows, most 'DLL' files have some functions that you can call using the 'rundll32.exe', the 'rundll32.exe' is an executable program that can only be accessed using command line and using this program you can execute some functions of some 'DLL' files that can help you better control the Windows operation system whether you're a programmer or not, the problem is it's kinda hard to figure out which 'DLL' file can execute which functions, the FunList Tool uses another executable file called 'dumpbin.exe' and this program is also only accessible through command line and what it does is it lists all the possible functions that can be given to a 'DLL' file in an easy-to-understand order although it does not explain what every function is used for.

through the FunList tool you can give the path of any 'DLL' file and this program will list all the functions that can be called using this 'DLL' file ,and that file is located in the 'System32' folder then you don't have to type the whole path of the file you just have to check the 'System32' checkbox and then
enter the name of the file and the program will do the rest.
